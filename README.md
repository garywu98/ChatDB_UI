# ChatDB UI

A React-based user interface that connects to a MongoDB database and leverages OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT to convert natural language prompts into MongoDB queries, allowing CRUD operations through conversational input.

### Features:
  - Natural language to MongoDB queries: Type human language commands and have them translated into MongoDB queries automatically.
  - CRUD operations: Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on your MongoDB collections.
  - Real-time interaction: Chat interface for submitting prompts and viewing responses.
  - Easy configuration: Connect to your MongoDB instance by providing database name and API keys.

### Technologies Used:
  - React with Material UI for the frontend
  - OpenAI ChatGPT API integration
  - MongoDB backend (accessed via API)
  - Fetch API for communication between frontend and backend
